Repo for the midterm assignments for the Intelligent Systems for Patter Recognition course

 - Midterm 1: Implementation of Blob detection using a Laplacian of Gaussian filter and tests on some images.
 - Midterm 2: Implementation of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine with testing done on the MNIST dataset by reconstructing test samples.
 - Midterm 3: Implementation of denoising autoencoders with layerwise pretraining and finetuning for the MNIST dataset. Experiments on latent space interpolation between the encodings of digits.
